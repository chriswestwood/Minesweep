## About
Minesweeper is a puzzle game, where the objective is to reveal all of the non mined tiles. Each tile is given a numerical value based on the amount of mines immediately surrounding it, this gives the player an indication of where the mines could be located allowing the for the deduction of safe tiles. Players can also flag a tile that they suspect of being a mine, allowing for easy remembering and stops any accidental clicking.
